Lottery Task (Extention):
I have done the extention to this, where user inputs 7 numbers, and this input is verified.
They then see the correct numbers, and told how many they got right and what those correct numbers are.
However, I did not quite understand what was meant by the probability, so I assumed it was the probability of picking the numbers they picked.

inp = list(map(int, list((input("Enter 7 numbers, between 1 and 49, separated by a single space \n")).split())))

count = 0
correct = []

#Verifying input
if len(inp) != 7:
    print("Invalid input: Input must be 7 numbers")
elif max(inp) > 49 or min(inp) < 1:
    print("Invalid input: Input must be in range 1-49")
elif len(set(inp)) != 7:
    print("Invalid input: Input must not contain duplicate numbers")

#If input is valid, then continues

    time.sleep(3)
    #The probability of picking 7 different numbers between 1 and 49 is 49 x 48 x 47 x 46 x 45 x 44 x 43 which is 432,938,943,400 
    print(f"\nThe lottery numbers are {nums}")
    time.sleep(1)

    for i in inp:
        if i in nums:
            count += 1
            correct.append(i)
